<h1>Configuration: Database</h1>
    <br><b>File:</b> /configuration/database.cfg<br><br>
    This configuration file can be used to insert vehicles to the internal database when the application is started.
    The configuration file is a text file and can look like this:
<pre># ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# INITIAL DATABASE
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# Specify a list of database entries that should be inserted into the database when the
# application starts. Format is "IP:PORT@INTERFACE,dx,dy,dz,ox,oy,oz,NAME,DESCRIPTION",
# where INTERFACE=0.0.0.0 denotes the default network interface and [dx,dy,dz], [ox,oy,oz],
# NAME and DESCRIPTION are the properties of an info response message (IMP). The key
# is Database.Initial. Make sure that NAME and DESCRIPTION are strings between "-characters.
# An example line would be:
#   192.168.0.100:12345@0.0.0.0,2.0,1.0,0.5,0.0,0.0,0.0,"Vehicle Name","template"
#
# [Database.Initial]
#     192.168.0.100:12345@0.0.0.0,2.0,1.0,0.5,0.0,0.0,0.0,"Vehicle Name","template"
</pre>
    The following <a href="configuration.html">key values</a> can be set:
    <br>
    <table>
        <tr><th width="300px">Key value</th><th>Description</th></tr>
        <tr><td style="font-family: Courier-New;">Database.Initial</td><td>Specifies all database entries that should be inserted when the GCS is started.</td></tr>
    </table>

<h2>Database.Initial</h2>
    The key value <span style="font-family: Courier-New;">Database.Initial</span> can contain <a href="configuration.html">several associated values</a>.
    Each value is a string with the following format:
    <pre>"IP:PORT@INTERFACE,dx,dy,dz,ox,oy,oz,NAME,DESCRIPTION"</pre>
    Here <code>IP</code> and <code>PORT</code> specify the source IP address and the source port of the GNC module, respectively.
    <code>INTERFACE</code> specifies the network interface on which messages are to be received. If the computer on which the GCS is running has more than
    one network interface, you can select the IPv4 address of the desired network interface. If the value <code>"0.0.0.0"</code> is used, the
    default network interface is used. All subsequent values must be separated with commas. <code>dx,dy,dz</code>, <code>ox,oy,oz</code>, <code>NAME</code>
    and <code>DESCRIPTION</code> denote the dimension and offset of the vehicle cuboid and the name and description of the vehicle according to
    an Info Response Message of the <a href="https://github.com/RobertDamerius/InterModuleProtocol" target="_blank">Inter-Module Protocol</a>.
    Make sure that <code>NAME</code> and <code>DESCRIPTION</code> are strings between <code>"</code>-characters.
