<h1>Configuration: Database</h1>
    The GCS inserts vehicles to its internal database when the application is started.
    The database configuration is done via the <a href="configuration.html">configuration file</a>.
    The following excerpt shows an example for an initial database configuration:
<pre>{
    "initialDatabase": ["192.168.0.100:12345@0.0.0.0,2.0,1.0,0.5,0.0,0.0,0.0,\"Vehicle Name\",\"template\""]
}
</pre>
<br>
    The key <span style="font-family: Courier-New;">initialDatabase</span> in the <a href="configuration.html">configuration file</a> contains a list of strings, where each strings represents an entry for the database.
    A string has the following format:
    <pre>"IP:PORT@INTERFACE,dx,dy,dz,ox,oy,oz,NAME,DESCRIPTION"</pre>
    Here <code>IP</code> and <code>PORT</code> specify the source IP address and the source port of the GNC module, respectively.
    <code>INTERFACE</code> specifies the network interface on which messages are to be received. If the computer on which the GCS is running has more than
    one network interface, you can select the IPv4 address of the desired network interface. If the value <code>"0.0.0.0"</code> is used, the
    default network interface is used. All subsequent values must be separated with commas. <code>dx,dy,dz</code>, <code>ox,oy,oz</code>, <code>NAME</code>
    and <code>DESCRIPTION</code> denote the dimension and offset of the vehicle cuboid and the name and description of the vehicle according to
    an Info Response Message of the <a href="https://github.com/RobertDamerius/InterModuleProtocol" target="_blank">Inter-Module Protocol</a>.
    Make sure that <code>NAME</code> and <code>DESCRIPTION</code> are strings between <code>"</code>-characters that are escaped via <code>\</code>-characters.
