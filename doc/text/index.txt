<h1>Ground Control Station</h1>
    The Ground Control Station (GCS) is used to display the motion states and commands of various vehicles.
    Basically, the GCS is only a data sink. It decodes and visualizes messages of the <a href="https://github.com/RobertDamerius/InterModuleProtocol" target="_blank">Inter-Module Protocol (IMP)</a> format.
    IMP messages are used to exchange basic data between different modules of a GNC system (Guidance, Navigation, Control).
    Only generic messages are defined in the IMP, which are independent of vehicle type and application.
    Each GNC module is assigned to a vehicle and each vehicle is uniquely identified by its name. All supported messages
    are shown in the following table.

    The GCS only uses UDP messages.
    </div>

    <h3>Vehicle Position</h3>
    The navigation message of the IMP (0x4E) contains the position in Cartesian space (positionNED) as well as in geographic coordinates.
    If the position in Cartesian space is given, this position is used by the GCS. If this position (NED) is not contained in the navigation
    message, then the geographical position is used and transformed into a Cartesian coordinate system. The origin of the Cartesian coordinate
    system can be specified by a <a href="configurationorigin.html">configuration file</a>. If the configuration file is not used,
    the geographical position of the first received navigation message is used as the origin.
    

<h2>Vehicle Database</h2>
    In practice, the GCS does not need to be configured to add more vehicles. In the <a href="configurationnetwork.html">network configuration</a>
    of the GCS, it is specified on which UDP ports the GCS should listen to or which UDP multicast groups it should join. The GCS then automatically
    builds up an internal database to assign the source network addresses of the received IMP messages to specific vehicles. For this purpose, the GCS
    uses the "Info Request Message" and "Info Response Message" of the IMP.
    <h3>Example:</h3>
    The GCS receives a navigation message from the address (IP:PORT). Since the address is not yet assigned to a vehicle, the GCS sends a request
    (Info Request Message) back to the address (IP:PORT). Info Request Messages are only sent with a maximum frequency of 1 Hz. The module which has
    sent the navigation message now receives an Info Request Message from the GCS and has to answer with an Info Response Message. As soon as GCS
    receives an Info Response Message, the address (IP:PORT) is added to the database together with the vehicle name. The vehicle name is included
    in the Info Response Message together with the size of the vehicle. As soon as a vehicle is added into the internal database, it appears on the
    graphical display of the GCS. A vehicle is displayed as a cuboid whose size was transferred in the Info Response Message.

    <div class="note-green">
    <h3 class="note-green">Note</h3>
    Already added vehicles cannot be removed from the database, but the visibility of the vehicle can be adjusted. To clear the database the application must be restarted.
    </div>

    By using the <a href="configurationdatabase.html">database configuration file</a>, it is also possible to insert vehicles into the database when the GCS is started
    without them having to send an Info Response Message.

<h2>Controls</h2>
    The control depends on the camera mode, which can be changed in the <a href="view.html">view menu</a>.
