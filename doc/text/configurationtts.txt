<h1>Configuration: Text-To-Speech (TTS)</h1>
    The TTS configuration is done via the <a href="configuration.html">configuration file</a>.
    The GCS calls a system command where the actual command string
    is constructed from a pre-string, the text of an IMP Log Message and a post-string. The text of the log message must only contain the following characters:
    <code>[A-Z], [a-z], [0-9], [.], [,], [!], [?], [ ]</code>. If the GCS receives a log message from a known vehicle and all characters are within the valid range, then
    a command string is constructed. If the text-to-speech option is enabled in the configuration file, the system command is called.
    The pre- and post-strings depend on the operating system. The following example shows an excerpt of the configuration file.

            }
        }
    }
