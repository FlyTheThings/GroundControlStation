<h1>Log</h1>
    The upper toolbar contains the button to open the log menu. The log menu contains log messages in the form of text
    messages. Log messages can be sent to the GCS as IMP messages. The vehicle must be in the database of the GCS. As soon
    as the GCS receives a new log message, the log button text of the toolbar is colored red.
    <br><br>
    A log message consists of three columns:
    <h3>UTC</h3>
    Specifies the time at which the GCS received the log message.
    <h3>Source</h3>
    Specifies the vehicle that sent the message. The GCS itself can also add log messages. The source is then always "GroundControlStation".
    <h3>Message</h3>
    The actual text message. The window is limited in horizontal direction, therefore too long messages are not completely visible.
