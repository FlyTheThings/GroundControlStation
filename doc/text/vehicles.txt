<h1>Vehicles</h1>
    The upper toolbar contains the button to open the Vehicles menu. The Vehicles menu contains a list of vehicles
    that have been found since GCS was started.
    The GCS builds up a vehicle database internally at runtime. As soon as vehicles are in the database, these
    vehicles appear in the list as blue buttons. The following figure shows that a vehicle with the name "Test Vehicle"
    and the optional vehicle description "template". Clicking this button opens a window with vehicle-specific
    <a href="datasettings.html">data and settings</a>. The optional vehicle description corresponds to the description
    field of the Info Response Message (Inter-Module Protcol). If a vehicle is added, the subfolder "vehicle" is searched
    for a <a href="vehiclemesh.html">ply file</a> with the name of the vehicle description (in this case "template.ply").
